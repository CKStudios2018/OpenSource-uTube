# [OpenSource-uTube](https://chstudios2018.github.io/OpenSource-uTube/)
## YouTube, but it's open source, and Google monetisation free

## How it works:

- Upload your video to our site.
- It gets compressed af, then stored on our servers.
- Whenever someone wants to watch that video, it gets decompressed live, so as you watch it, it comes clear. (this may cause issues, such as excessive buffering, but I was couldn't figure any other way)
- Anyone who know how to fix pls do
